# Academia da Avicultura

Academia da Avicultura is a Brazilian e-learning company. At first, I worked with a designer to make a personalized homepage for them. After that, they asked for personalized FAQ and SOBRE pages, which I have done by myself based on the homepage design. Used semantic HTML5, SEO practices and lazy loading to improve the website performance. This was my first freelance job. They used this project for over 2 years before they changed to another platform and made some changes to the original website. The version that you see on their website today is slightly different from this one, that's why I'm turning this project public now.
